👍🎉 Thanks a lot for considering contributing 🎉👍

We welcome and encourage contribution. There is many ways to contribute: you can
write bug report, contribute code or documentation.

## Reporting issues

When reporting issues the more information you can supply the better.

 - **Information about the environment:** On what OS, version of OS etc are you running the scripts
 - **How to reproduce the issue:** Step-by-step guide on how the issue can be reproduced (or at least how you reproduce it).
 Include everything you think might be useful, the more information the better.

## Improvements request and proposal

Feel free to make an issue to request a new functionality.

## Contributing code/Pull-Request

We welcome code contribution, this can be done by starting a pull-request.

If the change is big, typically if the change span to more than one file, consider starting an issue first to discuss the improvement.
This will makes it much easier to accept the changes.

There is some basic requirement for us to merge a pull request:
 - Describe the change
 - Refer to any issues it effects
 - Separate one pull request per functionality: if you start writing "and" in the feature description consider if it could be separated in two pull requests.
